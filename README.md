Module 12: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to present UFO sighting data in a visually appealing webpage. Specifically, JavaScript was used to display and filter the data based on the date, location, or shape of the UFO sighting.
## Results

The webpage is very interactive! Users can enter a Date, City, State, Country, or Shape to see what UFO Sightings have been recorded. There is no need to click on any buttons; the table should update automatically! See Figure 1.

Note that spelling is important here. Dates should be entered using the (M/DD/YYYY) format. For example, "1/9/2010" will yield results, while "01/09/2010" will not. Also note that cities, states, countries, and shapes should all be entered in lower case. The table will display no data if these conventions are not followed. See Figures 2 and 3 for examples of correct vs incorrect date entries.

The filter tool allows for multiple entries, see Figure 4 for spheres observed on 1/10/2010.

## Summary
Although this tool is interactive and the webpage is visually appealing, there are some drawbacks to this website. The filters are finicky with regards to spelling, capitalization, and date entry. End user errors will result in no data displayed.

I would recommend that this tool is further developed to allow for a little more "wiggle room" with regards to date, city, state, and country entry. I anticipate that users might be frustrated by the filter search's strict capitalization and date entry rules. Furthermore, I would also recommend an additional filter to allow users to search for "blurbs" or descriptions of the UFO sightings. This would allow for more personalized searches.
